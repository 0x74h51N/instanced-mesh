`InstancedMesh2` is an enhanced alternative to [`InstancedMesh`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/InstancedMesh), 
offering improved performance and usability with features such as:

- **Per-instance frustum culling** – *Skips rendering for out-of-view instances.*
- **Sorting** – *Reduces overdraw and efficiently manages transparent objects.*
- **Spatial indexing (dynamic BVH)** – *Speeds up raycasting and frustum culling.*
- **Dynamic capacity** – *Seamlessly add or remove instances.*
- **Per-instance visibility and opacity** – *Individually toggle visibility and set opacity.*
- **Object3D-like instances** – *Instances behave like [`Object3D`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D), supporting transforms and custom data.*
- **Per-instance uniforms** – *Assign unique shader data to individual instances.*
- **Level of Detail (LOD)** – *Dynamically adjust instance detail based on distance.*
- **Shadow LOD** – *Optimize shadow rendering by reducing detail for distant instances.*
- **Skinning** – *Apply skeletal animations for complex and dynamic movements.*

:::note 
Currently, `InstancedMesh2` only works with [`WebGLRenderer`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer) 
and requires [`three.js r159+`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).

### Differences from `InstancedMesh`

##### `InstancedMesh`
- Uses an [`InstancedBufferAttribute`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/InstancedBufferAttribute) to store instance matrices and data.
- Renders instances sequentially, meaning all instances are processed in the order they were added, without skipping or reordering. 
  This can be inefficient when dealing with a large number of instances, especially if many are off-screen or require different sorting orders for transparency.

##### `InstancedMesh2`
- Uses [`SquareDataTexture`](https://agargaro.github.io/instanced-mesh/api/classes/squaredatatexture/) 
  (an extended version of [`DataTexture`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/textures/DataTexture) supporting partial updates) 
  to store instance matrices and data.
- Uses an `InstancedBufferAttribute` to manage the indexes of instances to be rendered, allowing for selective rendering, efficient culling, 
  and sorting before sending data to the GPU.

:::note 
Due to this additional indirection, rendering ***all*** instances is slightly slower. <br/>
However, the benefits of efficient culling and sorting often outweigh the minor overhead. <br/>
If none of the extra features are needed, using `InstancedMesh` is recommended.
