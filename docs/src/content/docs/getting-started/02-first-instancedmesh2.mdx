title: Your First InstancedMesh2
---

### Initializing `InstancedMesh2`

Start by initializing an `InstancedMesh2`:

```ts
const iMesh = new InstancedMesh2(geometry, material);
```

### Adding and Positioning Instances

Next, add instances and set their positions:

```ts
iMesh.addInstances(count, (obj, index) => {
  obj.position.x = index;
});
```

:::note
The `obj` used in the callback is an [`InstancedEntity`](https://agargaro.github.io/instanced-mesh/api/classes/instancedentity), 
an object similar to [`Object3D`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D), allowing transformations and custom data.
:::

### Example

:::note 
All examples use the [`@three.ez/main`](https://github.com/agargaro/three.ez) package to simplify application development. <br/>
However, `InstancedMesh2` is fully compatible with other libraries.
