title: Your First InstancedMesh2
---

We start by creating an `InstancedMesh2`:

```ts
const iMesh = new InstancedMesh2(geometry, material);
```

After that we add and place the instances:

```ts
iMesh.addInstances(count, (obj, index) => {
  obj.position.x = index;
});
```

### Example

In this example, an `InstancedMesh2` is instantiated and 9 instances are added, positioned and colored:

:::note 
All examples use the [`@three.ez/main`](https://github.com/agargaro/three.ez) package to simplify writing the application. 
`InstancedMesh2` it's compatible with any other library.
