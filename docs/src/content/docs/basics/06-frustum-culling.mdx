title: Frustum Culling
---

With frustum culling, instances outside the camera's frustum are not rendered. <br/>
This saves GPU resources by using the CPU to calculate the indices to render.

```ts
iMesh.perObjectFrustumCulled = true; // default is true
```

### How It Works

Frustum culling is performed every frame in two ways:
- **Linear (default):** Iterates through all instances, checking if their boundingSphere is inside the camera's frustum. 
  **Best for dynamic scenarios**.
- **BVH:** [If a BVH is built](https://agargaro.github.io/instanced-mesh/basics/09-bvh-build/), 
  its nodes are recursely iterated. If a node is outside the camera's frustum, the node and all its children are discarded. 
  **Best for mostly static scenarios**.

### When Not to Use It

Sometimes, frustum culling can be more costly than beneficial, so it's better to skip it if:

- Most instances are always within the camera's frustum.
- The geometry is too simple (e.g., cubes, blades of grass, etc.).

### Disable Autoupdate

It's possible to disable the automatic computing of frustum culling and sorting before each rendering in this way:

```ts
iMesh.autoUpdate = false;

// compute frustum culling and sorting manually
iMesh.performFrustumCulling(camera);
```

### `OnFrustumEnter` Callback

When frustum culling is performed, the [`onFrustumEnter`](https://agargaro.github.io/instanced-mesh/api/classes/instancedmesh2/#onfrustumenter) 
callback is called for each instance in the camera frustum. 
This callback is very useful for animating only the bones of visible instances.

**If the callback returns true, the instance will be rendered**.

```ts
iMesh.onFrustumEnter = (index, camera) => {
  // render only if not too far away
  return iMesh.getPositionAt(index).distanceTo(camera.position) <= maxDistance;
};
```
